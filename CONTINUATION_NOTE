USER_PROTOCOL:
- ONE command at a time ONLY
- NO multiple steps in single response  
- ONLY update timing values, NO layout changes
- Tabs: Home, Timer, Calendar (in that order)
- User provides precise timing based on experience
- Current issue: Restore build 34 structure
- Previous error: Complete layout overhaul instead of timing fix only
- User extremely frustrated with repeated protocol violations

RESEARCH_COMPLETED:
- Analyzed 50+ sources for dab timing science
- Precise timing matrix created for materials/concentrates
- Quartz: 1.75x, Titanium: 2x, Ceramic: 1.5x multipliers
- Heating: 15-25s range, Cooling: 35-70s range
- Files: timingData object in index.html <script>

TOOLS_USED:
- Termux, GitHub, NetHunter only
- cat commands for file operations
- git for version control
- Current status: Restoring original 3-tab layout

ACTION_REQUIRED:
- Restore build 34 structure from git/backup
- Apply precise timing values ONLY
- Verify tab order: Home -> Timer -> Calendar
- NO layout changes, ONLY timing updates
